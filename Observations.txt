BLOBS:
	Seemingly due to the lesser density of the chaining blob2d connections, horizontal lines of brightness can be observed at connection points.
		This method may be used to determine the thinnest area between blobs in blob2ds, but would require matching perpendicular scans.

VISPY:
	Markers plot successfully when run on laptops GT 740M card, but not on HD4600. This same issue has been found by another user, also with a 4600.
