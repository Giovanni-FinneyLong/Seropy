Installation instructions:
-Download anaconda from here:https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows making sure to get the python 3.x version not 2.x
-Install anaconda, choosing to add anaconda to the system's path variable
-Prepend the anaconda bin directory to your path if has not been added. You can check if you need to do this step by opening a command prompt window, and entering 'conda' <enter>. 
	If a list of options is found, anaconda has been added to your path
--Now need to install Munkres library, which is used to match together pixels to be stitched
-Use 'pip install Munkres'. Note that if you have another version of python installed, using pip like so may cause you to install the library elsewhere than intended
	To make sure, you can run 'pip -V', and confirm that the python version is 3.x. Alternatively, you can run 'which pip', and confirm that the result is a subdirectory of anaconda. 
	Otherwise, use the full path 'C:\<directory sequence>\anaconda3\pip.py install Munkres'
-Now install the visualization library Vispy, with 'conda install vispy'. You can expect a few other items to be installed as well.
-Now clone the git repo
	The recommended command is 'git clone https://gfinneylong@bitbucket.org/gfinneylong/serotonin.git'
	Note that this will do a HTTPS clone, which means re-entering username & password on each git interaction
-copy the file 'config.py' into a new file 'myconfig.py'
	Modify any flags or global variables within this file; it is reloaded each time sero.py is run
	This includes setting up the involved directories. Currently these will not be created if they don't exist
-Run with 'python sero.py'
