Installation instructions:
-Download anaconda from here:https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows making sure to get the python 3.x version not 2.x
-Install anaconda, choosing to add anaconda to the system's path variable
-Prepend the anaconda bin directory to your path if has not been added. You can check if you need to do this step by opening a command prompt window, and entering 'conda' <enter>. 
	If a list of options is found, anaconda has been added to your path
--Now need to install Munkres library, which is used to match together pixels to be stitched
-Use 'pip install Munkres'. Note that if you have another version of python installed, using pip like so may cause you to install the library elsewhere than intended
	To make sure, you can run 'pip -V', and confirm that the python version is 3.x. Alternatively, you can run 'which pip', and confirm that the result is a subdirectory of anaconda. 
	Otherwise, use the full path 'C:\<directory sequence>\anaconda3\pip.py install Munkres'
-Now install the visualization library Vispy, with 'conda install vispy'. You can expect a few other items to be installed as well.
